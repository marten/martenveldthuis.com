# Information Architects - Writer for iPad

Information Architects â€“ Writer for iPad. Seems really nice, going by the
blogpost. But they make the same mistake most other Dropbox-enabled writing
apps make. They claim their own directory in the root folder of my Dropbox
account. That's pretty-much a no-go for me, it clutters up my Dropbox, and
makes it hard to keep all files for a project together. And it turns Dropbox
into a syncing service where each app just has its own data silo, where there
is no interaction between apps, because they can't (not by limitation of
Dropbox, but by their own silly thinking) reach eachothers files. Then we're
basically back to square one: select all, copy, switch app, paste in new
document, edit there. Lather, rinse, repeat.
