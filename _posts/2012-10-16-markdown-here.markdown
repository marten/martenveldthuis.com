Browser plugin (Firefox/Chrome) that turns a piece of (markdown-formatted) text in a text area into nicely formatted HTML. Works with Gmail, and also with GitHub Flavoured Markdown (code highlighting!). I'm so gonna use the heck out of this. Unless I forget I've got it installed of course. Which tends to happen.
