Could be, but don't forget network effects. A retina display would likely be
one of the differentiating factors between the iPad and other tablet devices
for a while. And geeks would likely weigh the pixel density in their decision
on what tablet to get.

The masses tend to buy the devices they see in use. So if you want to capture a
new market, you should capture the early-adopters, and they *are* the kind of
people who like things like a retina display.
