title: Unity and focus follows mouse
layout: post

Speaking of Ubuntu, the new Unity shell breaks focus follows mouse (a global
menu at the top of the screen doesn't work too well when the app it represents
changes as you move the pointer towards it). Which is bad enough in it's own
right, but that they [knew about it and just don't
care](https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/674138), that's a lot worse. They
couldn't even be bothered to remove the FFM-preference...
